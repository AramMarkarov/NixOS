# NixOS

This is my nixos github page containing nix files. These will make up my laptop and desktop setups.

This is the base configuration for my desktop. Periodically I will update this branch to the master branch.

Things that need fixing:
* swww-daemon background in nix config
* LACT daemon
* Firefox extensions autoadd using nix
* Cursor is not set correctly
