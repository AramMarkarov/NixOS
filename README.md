# NixOS

This is my nixos github page containing nix files. These will make up my laptop and desktop setups.

Differences for the laptop configuration
* Games and game libraries not included
* Audio more latent and lower sample rate
* Hyprland config adjusted for different monitor

Things that needs fixing
* Waybar theming
* Audio using speakers
* Fan control?
