# NixOS

This is my nixos github page containing nix files. These will make up my laptop and desktop setups.
Please note that this config updates slower since I use it less.

Differences for the laptop configuration
* Games and game libraries not included
* Audio more latent and lower sample rate
* Hyprland config adjusted for different monitor
